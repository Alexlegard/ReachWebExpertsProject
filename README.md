## About RWEStore

RWEStore is a restaurant finder application as well as an ecommerce website. Users are able to browse various restaurants for meals. They can place orders but won't actually be charged for anything as this isn't a real store. Users have profiles, and they can change their avatar, view their favorite restaurants, view other users they are following, and so forth. Restaurants have product offerings, and they can also be commented on by the users. So that describes the basic functionality of the website.

The website is controlled by a single super admin as well as many different restaurant owners. Restaurant owners can manage their restaurants, dish offerings, their restaurant reviews, view their orders and revenue, and much more. I've also integrated ChartJS so the admin can view their sales at a glance in a nice, readable format. As mentioned, the site is controlled by a super admin (myself) who has absolute control over the website's content.


## To recruiters (or whom it might concern)

You can create a user account to see what the user experience is like. If you want a restaurant owner account, please send me an email explaining why you want a restaurant owner account. I will then create an account for you and send you the credentials.
